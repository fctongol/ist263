    Francine Tongol

    I’m a communications design major interested in creating website designs and UX/UI Design for mobile applications.

    My accomplishments include winning the Northwell Health Spark Challenge for poster design twice in a row, receiving an award for Innovation & Creativity from R.I.T. and finally being employed as a Graphic Designer/Programmer at The Public Relations & Marketing group since my junior year of high school. 

    My skills include proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, and HTML/CSS.

    Outside of work, I love to destress with either painting or going to the gym. My other hobbies include cooking, reading, listening to music, or going out friends.
    My favorite TV shows are Euphoria and Life Unexpected. 
    My favorite singers are SZA and Tink. 

    I’m in a family of four with both my parents and my little brother. We moved to the States when I was 3 years old. Most of my extended family doesn’t live in the US, and rather in the Philippines or various countries in the world.

    I have a weird habit of comparing the price of clothes to how many steaks I can buy with it to prevent myself from spending too much money. 

    My interests include anything in fashion, beauty, finance, graphic design, and entrepreneurship.
