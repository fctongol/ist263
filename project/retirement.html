                    <p class="pagetext">
                        A retirement savings and investing plan that employers usually offer. Unless you’re balancing a
                        full-time job with benefits along with your classes, this plan is something just to consider
                        once you graduate and are looking for your first jobs.<br>
                        <br>The amount of money put into your 401k is automatically taken from your paychecks and are
                        invested in a pool of mutual funds of your choosing.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="pageptitle3">Why do a 401(k) rather than investing yourself? |</h3>
                    <p class="pagetext">If you’re fortunate, your employer offers to match a portion of how much you put into your 401(k) in
                        which case, you’re getting more put into your investment without hurting your paycheck.
                        <br><br>This can also be considered as a passive form of investing as your employers are handling most
                        of the work while you simply just have to provide and choose.
                        <br><br>401(k) contributions can lower your income taxes. Meaning the amount of your income that you
                        contributed to a 401(k) is subtracted from your total income, and that amount is what’s taxed.

                        Social security benefits covers multiple areas, and one of those is retirement. Employees who
                        worked in social security covered employment for a sufficient number of years are eligible for
                        retirement benefits by age 62. You usually must have worked a total of at least 10 years at a
                        nongovernmental jobs under these conditions. This is due to the need to accumulate 40 credits
                        that are earned by earning a minimum amount of money over a course of a year and it takes most
                        people a decade to add up to 40. This minimum amount is adjusted over time to keep up with
                        inflation.
                        <br><br>
                        This retirement benefit is in the form of a check that is given to you when you decide to begin receiving
                            benefits any time after you’re 62 years old. However, the amount of your benefits are permanent reduced
                            by a percentage if you claim them before you reach the full retirement age which is between 66 and 67.
                            <br><br>The monthly retirement benefit check varies from person to person depending on when you decided
                            to claim them and if your earnings were above average incomes.
                            <br><br>For example, those who retired in 2019 at their full retirement age got a maximum monthly benefit
                            of $2,861 per month -- or $34,332 for the whole year. For those who waited until age 70 to start
                            collecting benefits, the monthly maximum was $3,770, or $45,240 annually, while those who started at age
                            62 would have received a maximum of $2,209 per month, or $26,508 for the year
