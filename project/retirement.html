                        A retirement savings and investing plan that employers usually offer. Unless you’re balancing a
                        full-time job with benefits along with your classes, this plan is something just to consider
                        once you graduate and are looking for your first jobs.
                        <br>The amount of money put into your 401k is automatically taken from your paychecks and are
                        invested in a pool of mutual funds of your choosing.
                    </p>

            <h3>Why do a 401(k) rather than investing yourself?</h3>
            <p>If you’re fortunate, your employer offers to match a portion of how much you put into your 401(k) in
                which case, you’re getting more put into your investment without hurting your paycheck.
                <br><br>This can also be considered as a passive form of investing as your employers are handling most
                of the work while you simply just have to provide and choose.
                <br><br>401(k) contributions can lower your income taxes. Meaning the amount of your income that you
                contributed to a 401(k) is subtracted from your total income, and that amount is what’s taxed.

                <div>
                    <p>Social security benefits covers multiple areas, and one of those is retirement. Employees who
                        worked in social security covered employment for a sufficient number of years are eligible for
                        retirement benefits by age 62. You usually must have worked a total of at least 10 years at a
                        nongovernmental jobs under these conditions. This is due to the need to accumulate 40 credits
                        that are earned by earning a minimum amount of money over a course of a year and it takes most
                        people a decade to add up to 40. This minimum amount is adjusted over time to keep up with
                        inflation.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This retirement benefit is in the form of a check that is given to you when you decide to begin receiving
                benefits any time after you’re 62 years old. However, the amount of your benefits are permanent reduced
                by a percentage if you claim them before you reach the full retirement age which is between 66 and 67.
                <br><br>The monthly retirement benefit check varies from person to person depending on when you decided
                to claim them and if your earnings were above average incomes.
                <br><br>>For example, those who retired in 2019 at their full retirement age got a maximum monthly benefit
                of $2,861 per month -- or $34,332 for the whole year. For those who waited until age 70 to start
                collecting benefits, the monthly maximum was $3,770, or $45,240 annually, while those who started at age
                62 would have received a maximum of $2,209 per month, or $26,508 for the year
