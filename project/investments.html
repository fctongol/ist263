                    <p class="pagetext">Stocks are basically a representation of a piece of ownership in a company. When you own a stock,
                        you’re considered a shareholder because you ‘share’ a piece of that company along with other
                        people who own their stock. You can purchase as many shares as you want from a company and even
                        purchase parts of a share.</p>

                <h3 class="pageptitle2">| How do people earn money from the stock market?</h3>
                <p>The stock market is constantly fluctuating. How much a company’s share is worth can change drastically
                    from $10 to $50 in a day, or it can only change with a 10¢ difference. The value of the company’s shares
                    are fundamentally determined by the profits that the company makes from sales to investors to inflation
                    etc. People earn money the stock market when they buy a company’s shares at a low value then sell their
                    shares when they’re at a higher value.
                    <br><br>If you were to buy 1 share of a company for the price of $100, and then during market hours, the
                    value of the share goes up to $120, you can sell that share for $120, thus making a $20 profit. If you
                    were to have 2 shares of that company, you can sell both of them for a $40 profit, so on and so forth.
                    <br><br>This act of buying a share and selling it, is what’s considered as a trade.

                    <h3 class="pageptitle2">| When should I buy and when should I sell?</h3>
                    <p class="pagetext2">The obvious advice is to buy shares when they’re low and sell shares when they’re high. Although,
                        you can never know for sure when is the ideal time in which a share is considered low or high.
                        This is what makes the stock market intimidating because if you buy a share for $100 and over a
                        year the value of the share goes down to $10, you’ll essentially have lost $90 when you sell
                        those shares. The timeframe in which you buy shares and hold your shares before you sell it
                        varies as well. One of the more risky positions are day traders who trade their stocks within
                        the same day, but it’s relatively considered a gamble in that they trade these high volume
                        shares hoping and needing these shares to go up to sell for profit before the market closes.
                        <br><br>For college students, there’s rarely any time to constantly be watching the market,
                        waiting for stock prices to go up to catch the perfect moment to sell. This is why long-term
                        investing is considered more suitable for those who can’t be as dedicated to the market in
                        watching its trends day to day. The mindset of long-term investing involves researching on
                        companies you believe will become more successful in the future, buying some of their shares,
                        and holding onto those shares for years before selling. In most cases if you choose great
                        companies, you’ll likely sell with a substantial amount of profit.

                <h3 class="pageptitle2">| Why choose long-term investing over short-term?</h3>
                <p>This debate can be very convincing to the average person when you look at market summaries. If you were
                    to search up a market summary of a company’s stock, you’re usually presented with a huge value number,
                    some percentages, timeline tabs, and a graph. These graphs allow you to visually understand the trend in
                    which a company’s value goes towards, and because the market is so volatile, the trend of a company’s
                    value in a day could go down, but over 5 years, it’s constantly moving upward.
                    <br><br>Ex. In the course of 5 days during 2021, Google’s shares went from $2048 to $2002 which is
                    unfortunately a loss. In the course of 5 years, their share was valued at $744 in 2016 then $2097 in
                    2021. That is a $1353 profit per share you own!
                    <br><br>So let’s say you metaphorically started college in 2016 and graduated 2021. If you bought 10
                    shares of Google at the start of your college career for the price of $7440 in total, you would graduate
                    with that $7440 back in your pocket on top of a $13,530 profit.
                    <br><br>In short, long-term investing requires less effort in constant attention to the market as long
                    as you do your occasional, meaningful research, and it can benefit you with greater gains.

                        It can seem overwhelming to have to choose and research which individual companies and stocks to
                        purchase when dipping your toes into the stock market pool. It requires careful due diligence in
                        which the common student doesn’t have time for or the expertise to go through. This is where
                        index funds come in.
                        <br><br>Index funds are basically a group of stocks you invest your money into and you own a
                        small percentage of each of the stocks in the index. It tracks the market as a whole with these
                        multiple companies’ stocks rather than having to only deal with one specific stock. They’re
                        simple to put together, manage, and it’s a way to invest more passively.

            <h3 class="pageptitle2">| Why Index Funds?</h3>
            <p>“Several studies have suggested that over 92%-95% of portfolio managers could not out perform the market
                index over a 15-year period. And these figures are SO MUCH WORSE for the average individual investors.”
