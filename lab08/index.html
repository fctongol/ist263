    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    
    <p>
        Outside of work, I love to destress with either painting or going to the gym. 
        My other hobbies include:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Cooking</li>
             <li>Reading</li>
             <li>Listening to music</li>
             <li>Going out with friends</li>
         </ul>
         <p>My favorite TV shows are Euphoria and Life Unexpected. 
        <br>My favorite singers are SZA and Tink.</p>
    

    <p>
        I’m in a family of four with both my parents and my little brother. We moved to the States when I was 3 years old. 
        <br>Most of my extended family doesn’t live in the US, and rather in the Philippines or various countries in the world.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I have a weird habit of comparing the price of clothes to how many steaks I can buy with it to prevent myself from spending too much money.
    </p>

    <p>
        My interests include anything in fashion, beauty, finance, graphic design, and entrepreneurship.
